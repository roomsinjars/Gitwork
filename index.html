            their project.  If working on a project for the first time, you should create a directory and launch Gitwork from the newly created directory.</p>

                <li>You will need to clone a Github repo in order to continue.  Enter the URL to a current project on Github, and it will automatically be cloned to the directory in which you launched Gitwork.</li>
