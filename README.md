## Selecting a Repository

Post installation, Gitwork can be launched by typing "gw" into the command line. We recommend that you launch Gitwork in the directory that contains the .git folder for their project. If working on a project for the first time, you should create a directory and launch Gitwork from the newly created directory.

* The above screen will only appear if Gitwork is launched from a directory that does not contain a .git folder.
* You will need to clone a Github repo in order to continue. Enter the URL to a current project on Github, and it will automatically be cloned to the directory in which you launched Gitwork.

## Selecting a Branch

You will have the option to continue working on branch or create a new feature branch.

* The current list of available branches will be displayed for selection.
* You can also delete a branch if it is no longer needed. The new branch name must be a minimum of 4 characters long and cannot contain any spaces.

## Developing

You can notify Gitwork that they are done working on your feature by clicking the "next" button.

## Committing Work

Once done working on your feature, you will be given the ability to commit your work. Gitwork will automatically list all files that were changed since the previous commit. You should select the files that changed that you would like to commit.

![commit](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8791823/6994158/aa7e942c-dadc-11e4-9184-164a9cc4afe2.png)

* A valid commit message must be entered in order for the commit button to appear.
* Functionality is built in to commit additional files in the future, so you should not feel obligated to commit every file that you changed
* The "Refresh Files" button will only need to be selected if you make changes after entering the commit state.

# Next Steps
Select the option that best fits your goals. To continue working on the same feature branch, select "Continue Working on branch". If you would like to make a commit with additional files, select "Make New Commit". Or if you are ready to merge your changes with the master branch, select "Merge Branch with Master".

* All files must be committed prior to merging your feature branch with master. You will be sent back to the commit page if you attempt merging without committing all files.


## Merge Changes

Select "merge" to ensure your feature is incorporated into the most recent version of your project.

* The merge function will check if your branch is up to date with master. It will automatically make your branch current with master when "merge" is selected.
*You will be notified if your current branch in up to date with master. In which case you would not be required to merge.

## Push to Github

Selecting the "Push" button will push your feature branch to Github.
